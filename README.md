# Gruyere
Experimenting with Selenium Webdriver on the Google Gruyere web app

# Refactoring required

## Selenium Webdriver
- Get the tests to actually fail when the expected string is not returned! (e.g. as it would in Selenium Grid)
- Define the page objects to increase maintainability
- Implement TakesScreenshot on failure
- Create random username for sign up
- Find a better way targeting snippets once created
- Remove comments

## Cucumber
- Collaborate with the team :-)
- Define the page objects to increase maintainability
- Create Step Defs
